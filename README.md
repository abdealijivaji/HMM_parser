# HMM_parser

Trying to create a tool for parsing HMMer output with all columns included

This has been as part of a pet project of mine to develop my python skills. For any issues/suggestions, please create an issue on GitHub or feel free to email me at [abdeali\@vt.edu](mailto:abdeali@vt.edu){.email}

The script takes major influence from Thomas Hackl's seq-scripts repos [hmmer-tbl2tsv](https://github.com/thackl/seq-scripts/blob/master/bin/hmmer-tbl2tsv). Check out the repo for handy scripts for bioinformatics.

This project has been with great support of my advisor Frank Aylward at Virginia Tech, Department of Biological Sciences
